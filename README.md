## Instructions

1. Download the repository
2. Import the assets into your Horizon Worlds world
3. Attach scripts to the correct objects
4. Configure triggers, UI and interactions as described
5. Test the dungeon in Play/Preview mode


## ASSETS
The 3D assets are modular and adhere to a fixed size of 9 × 6 meters.
They can be modified and reused as you like. A texture is included.

All assets are ready to import into Meta Horizon. The pivot (PV) is already assigned 
and baked at the center-bottom of the mesh. Each object must keep its pivot centered at the bottom to work correctly within the asset system.

Any adjustments or the import of additional objects can be handled via scripts: in the Meta Horizon editor you can tweak the original pivot or apply a PVO (Pivot Override) as needed.

The scale is 1:1 for every object. These parameters can also be changed through the script properties the objects are attached to.

Feel free to customize the assets and create new ones to build fresh dungeons, levels, and escape rooms.
Have fun!

## Final Result

Your dungeon should be fully functional with interactive pickups and working triggers.
